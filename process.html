   <div class="c"> Step 1: Separate your clothes</div>
    White or light clothes should not be washed with colourful clothes, so it is important to stack clothes based on colour and fabric. Some brands provide wash care with their clothes, make sure you read them and wash accordingly.
    
    <div class="c">Step 2: Choose washing cycle</div>
    Choosing the right washing cycle is important to care for your clothes. Some delicate clothes might need just a few a cycle in the delicate mode and washing them in full cycle with hot water setting might damage the clothes.
    
    You should refer to the fabric care label of your garment when selecting the washing cycle. As a result, you will be able to keep your clothes clean while also protecting them.
    
   <div class="c" >Step 3: Set water temperature</div>
    Your laundry can be greatly improved when you use the right water setting in your washer. For instance, hot water kills and sanitises germs more efficiently, but in some cases, it can shrink clothes, fade fabrics, set certain stains, and use more energy. Towels, bedding, sturdy fabrics, kitchen towel, and extremely dirty items can be washed using hot water.
    
    Warm water should be used for moderately dirty loads, dark colours, and the permanent-press cycle. Also, when washing delicate items or clothes that have dyes that might bleed, use cold water on the delicate cycle. The gentlest way to wash your clothes is with cold water, which uses less energy and saves you money.
    
   <div class="c"> Step 4: Add detergent and fabric softener</div>
    It is important to read your washing machine’s manual before adding detergent and fabric softener. According to the type of washing machine and load size, the amount of detergent needed varies. So, look at the detergent box and the washing machine’s label to find out how much you should use. Using too much detergent could affect your clothes as well as your machine.
    
   <div class="c" >Step 5: Put in the clothes</div>
    Put your clothes in the washer. But keep in mind that overloading the machine may lead to your clothes not being properly washed. Additionally, incorrect amounts can lead to operational problems and damage to the machine.
    
    – Small loads: ⅓ of the drum
    
    – Medium loads: ½ of the drum
    
    – Large loads: ¾ of the drum
    
    <div class="c">Step 6: Turn on the washing machine</div>
    Close the lid of the washing machine, either the top load or the front load, and press the Start button. Some washing machines have a feature of indicating if the door is closed properly or not. To avoid accidents, always check before starting!
    
    <div class="c">Step 7: Take out the clothes, clean the washing machine</div>
    After the operation of the washing machine is done, open the door to let it air out so that mould and mildew cannot grow. You should clean your washing machine regularly with a washing machine cleaner like vinegar and baking soda, after all, if it’s not clean, it won’t do its job efficiently.
    
    Washing machine mistakes to avoid
    You should avoid making some common mistakes when doing laundry, in addition to overloading your machine and using too much detergent.
    
    – Check pockets: Be careful not to leave anything in the pockets. You should check the pockets for things like tissues, wallets, cash, or coins before you put them in the washer. Washing machines and clothes can be damaged by these things.
    
    – Find fabric softener dispenser: Do not directly put fabric softener into your laundry as it could stain them. Find the correct compartment in the detergent drawer for the softener – usually marked with a flower.</p>
